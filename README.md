# DEEP-LEARNING-ON-HOUSE-PRICES
In Project Week , you solved this project using Machine Learning models (example: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM).

In Week 3, you will solve the same problem, but this time with a Neural Network (Deep Learning) using PyTorch.

Your goal is to build an MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) model that can learn patterns in tabular data and predict:
